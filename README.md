# 🧠 CalmWell – Youth Mental Health Support Platform

CalmWell is a mental health platform designed specifically for youth to connect with mental health advisors and use AI-powered support tools like a mental health chatbot. Built for the Hackaura Hackathon, this project combines human empathy with AI-powered guidance to provide accessible mental health support.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Mental health issues among youth are rising at an alarming rate, yet access to professional help remains limited. Stigma, cost, and lack of awareness further prevent young people from seeking support. Many feel isolated and have no safe or private space to express themselves or get proper guidance.

---

## ✅ Proposed Solution

MindConnect bridges this gap by creating a platform where:

- Youth can **connect anonymously** with certified mental health advisors.
- Users have access to a **mental health chatbot** (powered by Wolfram) for private, real-time self-guided support.
- The platform provides **a dual-role system** – normal users (youth) and advisors (mental health professionals) – enabling one-on-one communication.
- With AI and human experts combined, users receive help whenever they need it.
